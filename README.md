 TAILWINDCSS:

This project recreates a modern hero section  using  "React", "TailwindCSS", and "Framer Motion". It includes a responsive layout, animated heading, typing effect, and call-to-action buttons — all coded from scratch without external UI kits.

 Features:

-  "Animated Headline" — “Design Made Intelligent”
-  "Typing Animation" — For the sub-headline
-  "Glowing Background Blobs" — Animate on all four corners
-  "Responsive Design" — Optimized for mobile and desktop
-  "Smooth Animations" — Handled with Framer Motion
-  "CTA Buttons" — Appear after typing completes
-  "Optional Looping Animation" — For continuous flow
